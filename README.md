this is a full-stack AI chatbot project using react and python created by -Hardik Shakya
for this program to funtion properly you will need to have ollamma installed and running in your system locally.
the program also uses gemma:2b and phi LLM's for the chat system, So you will need to fun the following code in the terminal after installing ollama:
-> ollama run phi
-> ollama run gemma:2b
-> ollama list (to check if the LLMs have been installed properly)
After this you will need to run the 2 backend python programs "AImodel_Phi.py" and "AImodel_gemma.py".
After the backend part is up and running you will need to run the frontend.
Now the program should be up and functioning properly.
